# Land your first job as a Product Manager

First question, do you know the difference between a Product Manager and a Product Owner? [Product Manager vs Product Owner](https://www.productplan.com/product-manager-vs-product-owner/)

Now, here are some tips for kickstarting your PM/PO career¬†üëá

## Combine many skills üõ†

Product Manager is a role were you get to combine **the business side**, **the technology side** and **the design side** of things and be involved in all parts of developing a product. The good news is that with le Wagon you acquired **tech skills**, and with your background you may already have **business skills**. So you may just need **design skills** and **methodology** to become a great Product Manager! 

The following sections give a brief overview of each of these:

### Design Skills

Normally, any PM (or serious PM aspirant) already has a **taste for product and a good general knowledge of UI**. He has an opinion on apps that have good ergonomics, he knows nice UI / UX examples by category (onboarding, payment, search, etc. ..). He has often trained himself on Photoshop or Sketch and has already hacked small models / prototypes inspired by the design of other applications.

  To be a good PM, you do not need to be an expert in Product Design, apply the latest methodologies or use the latest tools. You just need to :

  - **Have good UI practices**, **use common sense** and know how to **identify the right solution** in terms of ergonomics or interface that answers an identified problem.
  - **Know how to make small models / prototypes for developers** or to be able to **discuss challenges with the UX / UI designers** by using the correct vocabulary (when there is a UX / UI designer in the team).

  **The importance given to the design will depend on the product** (B2B vs B2C). Some teams will focus on the functional aspect of the product (in B2B, for example) or will outsource the graphic redesign later, whereas other businesses will aim for a pixel-perfect design from the start (usually for a B2C app).

**Learning Product Design in a professional way is not a game changer to be or become PM**

Here is a good lecture to get the basis of UX :
- [Ultimate Guide to UX](https://www.udemy.com/ultimate-guide-to-ux/)

### Dev Skills

On the dev side, **all PMs need basic knowledge of code**. A PM performs **SQL queries** almost every day to query the database and answer business questions, quantify the impact of a problem and then prioritize it.

- Where does the funnel break?
- How many users are affected?
- What are the profiles of these users?

The need for extensive dev knowledge depends a lot on the technical team:
- **With a team of junior developers**, the PM needs to break features in small bricks (e.g. "implement a carousel on the product page") and detail the specs very precisely. At some companies, such as Talent.io it can get even more granular. A PM might have to tell developers that they have to *"implement this particular method in such controller"*.
- **With a more senior dev team**, features can be bigger and more grouped meaning that specs will be more "high level" (i.e. "implement a sign in / sign up funnel"). In this case, the PM will have to provide a detailed prototype of the feature which will then be enough for the devs to create it.


In any case, **dev knowledge is a must-have and clearly a differentiating factor in getting a candidate out of the lot on PM recruitment**. This is good news given you've just finished a coding bootcamp üòú. But it's competitive out there. As an example, most PMs at large US companies all have very technical backgrounds (computer science / engineers).


### Soft Skills & Methodology

A very important dimension of PM's job is **the working method**, how to organize a roadmap / prioritize problems / cut it in tasks. Again, there is no good methodology because it depends on the context:
- Maturity of the product (pre or post product / market fit)
- Volume of problems to manage in the roadmap
- Available data volumes
- Experience of the tech team

Here some lectures to know more about Agile methodology : 
- [Introduction to agile project management](https://www.udemy.com/introductionto-agile-project-management/)
- [Learn about agile project management and scrum](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/4544621-learn-about-agile-project-management-and-scrum)

The working method is difficult to teach because it depends on the company, as well as the business context. You've got to learn it on the job - encountering real problems on real products! Which leads us nicely on to:

## How to nail your product interview  üõ´

### Typical interview process ‚úçÔ∏è

#### First Round : Classic call

It takes usually 20-30 minutes. This is a simple filtering process for companies. They need to find out a bit more about you and your experience, see if you match with the desired profile, and check that your personality is a good fit for the company. You'll probably be given a little more information about the role itself on this call too.

#### Second Round : technical test

A technical test for PMs can take 3 different forms:

- Quick logic questions about product with one of the existing Product Managers.
- A test - 45 minutes to prepare a report, followed by a presentation of that report to the panel.
- A test/project to do at home in few days.

The technical questions can be about :
- Logic : _"Looking at a list of 15 tasks, how you would you go about prioritizing them? Is there a specific method you would to use to classify them?"_ 
- Technical culture : "what's an API?" or "what's the difference between cookies and a cache on a website?"
- Product culture : "Why do you use this product everyday?", "what is a good / successfull feature?" or "Is there an app you use everyday but find poorly executed? why?"
- Product marketing KPIs : "which KPIs would you track and how after the launch of this feature ?" or "which features would you implement to increase the retention rate ?"

You can find other relevant product tests here:
- [here in üá´üá∑](product_test_french.md)
- [here in üá¨üáß](product_test_english.md)

Technical tests are here to evaluate your ability to :
- analyze a product
- make hypothesis
- suggest feature ideas / optimizations 
- make the right decisions according to the vision and the roadmap
- organize the tasks and deliver properly
- evaluate the success of a new product / feature

Don't hesitate to say what you think, interviewers are not expecting you to say the product is perfect. On the contrary, your critical mind, analysis and relevant recommendations will do the difference as long as it is justified. 

#### Third Round : Meeting with the team

You'll meet the Product team, developers for sure, designers, business dev and HR

#### Fourth Round : Meeting with the CEO / CTO

Last meeting with the CEO of the company in question

These two 'final' interviews are very much about personality and general dynamism. A PM can be quite a high-pressure job, so the interviewers will be looking to see how you react under pressure, how you think, how you prioritize tasks & manage your time, and how good you are at getting on with people!


### After the Interview üòá

* email them straight away saying thanks and loved it
* email a week later
* and if you don't hear again for a few weeks, send a third email, politely asking for an update

One of the most common mistakes people make is to do one interview at a time, wait for an answer and then move on if they don't get it. üö´ Do not do this! üö´ Keep applying for jobs at the same time as your current interview. Don't wait for one answer or pin all your hopes on one job before moving on. You'll waste so much time, and will suffer more emotionally if you get any rejections. It can also even put you in a dream position if you are offered two jobs at the same time - you can use the other company offer as leverage to negotiate a better salary. On the subject of salary though, remember that it isn't as important as being in a good team. Go somewhere where you are going to learn and be tested.

Finally, don't take rejection personally. Just because they said no this time, doesn't mean they will never want you. So stay in touch and most importantly, always be nice! You never know when your paths might cross again in the future.
