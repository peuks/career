# Using Kitt after the Bootcamp ¬†

You have been using Kitt intensively during the last couple of weeks to learn programming. You watched lessons, played flashcards, solved challenges and tracked the advancement of your product. Well the good news is that you've now got lifetime access to these. You'll be able to access Kitt anytime you want to go back and rehearse a particular part of the curriculum. You can even do the entire bootcamp again if you want! üòâ

Kitt is much more than a learning tool though. It supports our **community**; the one you now belong to. Here are a few quick tips on how to properly use Kitt to get the most out of it!

## Keep your profile up to date üë©‚Äçüíª

This is the part where you let other alumni know who you are, and what you're up to. You can toggle your status, selecting from the following three categories:

- **Freelance** if people can hire you on short-term contracts
- **For Hire** if you are actively looking for a job (internship / full-time)
- **Entrepreneur** if you are founding a company

In addition to that status, we encourage you to fill in the **Skills** section with the stuff that's _not necessarly_ related to programming. The Wagon's community is full of diverse people with all kind of backgrounds in Accounting, Finance, Food, Marketing, Medicine, E-Commerce, Distribution, Consulting etc. If a skill is missing, ping `@ssaunier` on Slack to ask him to add it!

Finally, if you have not set your Linkedin URL, please do so. We will monitor it to update your Kitt profile automatically (giving you less to do in order to stay up to date).


Keeping your profile up to date will give you **opportunities**:

- Other alumni / teachers may reach out to you when looking for a freelancer
- Other alumni looking for a job would check out your entrepreneur profile and the company you are building to apply
- If you set yourself **For Hire** we will do our best to match you with the most relevant companies

## Contact Le Wagon's staff üëã
