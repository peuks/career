# Get your first job as a Growth Manager

Growth is not a new discipline.
The very concept of Growth was shaped by Sean Ellis almost 10 years ago when he invented the AARRR framework.

[**Numerous examples**](https://optinmonster.com/growth-hacking-examples/) from some of the best start-ups have now proven the effectiveness of this discipline in the digital industry, and it's no wonder that in the last 2 years, the Growth Manager has become one of the most important positions in start-ups. In the United States he is even one of the core components of the most successful new organizations.

On a daily basis, the missions of the Growth Manager are very diverse, and this is partly what makes the job so rich.
However, they all converge towards a single goal: To create, optimize, and amplify growth ‚úÖ

## Now, here are some tips to start your Growth Manager Career

The Growth Manager is a job that requires many skills and knowledge. We talk about **T-shaped Skills.**
![enter image description here](https://www.zupimages.net/up/20/10/4fb5.png)


The Growth Manager **reports to the Sales Director** or **directly to the CEO.**
But on a daily basis, depending on the size of your organization, you will have to deal with mainly three departments:
-   The product department
-   The sales department
-   The Marketing Department

For this, it is essential to have, at the forefront of all skills, an **excellent sense of communication.**
During your mission you will have to set up many tests, 9 out of 10 of which will not work. It's normal, a Growth Team explores new ways to find new growth relays. Its goal is to identify frictions and optimize value-creating processes.
It is important to make your employees understand that for you failure is the norm.
The Growth Manager must also have a global vision of the company's objectives.

**He must ensure that his objectives are always aligned with those of the CEO or the general strategy of the organization**, and be able to understand all the micro-workings of the machinery.

In addition, a **good technical mastery of the front-end,** and of the **many tools** is almost indispensable in order to be able to deploy your tests autonomously, deploy custom landing pages, **code a script in python or Ruby** and understand how the tools and processes work together in order to be able to find new growth opportunities.

**When you get out of the Wagon, you have the technical mastery to get up and running quickly**. Here is a [**list of tools**](https://www.growthhacking.fr/t/la-toolbox-du-growth-hacker/9188)  that may be useful to you. 

## Preparing for the interview

More than any other job, the Growth job requires **an excellent knowledge of the company and its market**. We recommend that you research in depth the acquisition strategies already in place and those of competitors.

At the beginning of your mission, it is recommended to set up an audit. You can follow [**this template**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eYCkZ4QyFFAF-MihaBUodimrRRVjzcEe0jtoxQ4oz_A/edit?usp=sharing) which will give you a precise vision of the situation and the questions after which you should be able to align elements of response.

### How to nail your interview Growth
The concept of growth can take as many forms as there are business models.
For this reason there is no standard maintenance.
[**This article**](https://andrewchen.co/growth-interview-questions-atlassian-surveymonkey-gusto-hubspot/) on Andrew Chen's blog will give you an idea of different questions asked at Hubspot, Gusto, Atlassian or SurveyMonkey.

### Interview process
Here is a recent testimonial of a recruitment process among our friends at Spendesk that can give you a more precise idea of what to expect.
*"I applied via a recruiter. The process took +4 weeks. I had an interview at Spendesk (Paris) in January 2020"*: 

**Step 1**
1st phone interview to present the position quickly and see if it matches my search (30 minutes)

**Step 2**
In Physics, ITW to explain more in depth the missions of the position and give more context (this is a new position)

**Step 3**
ITW with two members of the Growth team (45 minutes each) --> questions both personal and related to my experiences

**Step 4**
An afternoon of technical test + quick interview with the Head of Ops

**Step 5**
Interview with the CRO (45 minutes)

**After the interview** 
Write to them right away and say thank you, and I loved it. Email one week later. If you don't hear from them for a few weeks, send a third email, politely asking for an update.
Write to them right away and say thank you, and I loved it.
‚ö†Ô∏è One of the most common mistakes you make is to conduct one interview at a time, wait for a response, and then continue if you don't get one. Don't do it! Continue to apply for a job at the same time as your current interview. Don't wait for an answer and don't pin all your hopes on this job before continuing.  You will spend so much time and suffer more emotionally if you are rejected. It can even put you in a dream position if you are offered two jobs at the same time - you can use another company's offer as leverage to negotiate a better salary.  When it comes to wages, remember that it's not as important as being part of a good team.  Go to a place where you can learn and be tested.
Finally, don't take no for an answer.  Just because they said no this time doesn't mean they'll never want you.  So stay in touch, and above all, stay courteous!
You never know when your paths might cross again in the future.
