## Test Data Analyst

### Foreword

This is just a test to evaluate your average skills and experience. There isn't a unique way to succeed it. Different candidates can succeed it in many different ways. Just try to do your best while enjoying it. We are a tech company that deeply believe in data driven processes and a data driven mindset is what we look for.

### Theory assignment
Answer the following questions by giving us some details and arguments to better understand your point of view (10 lines max).
1- Which skills or programming languages do you most frequently use in your work? Why?
2- Which was the most game changing insight you ever discovered? Why it was so crucial under a technical and business point of view?

### Technical assignments

#### EX. 1
**Dataset** ðŸ‘‰ [Spotify]( https://www.kaggle.com/edumucelli/spotifys-worldwide-daily-song-ranking)

#### Context
A decade ago Spotify started changing how people listen to music. Today this service is redefining how music is produced and artists are scouted too. Streaming data are the new Eldorado for labels who want to produce the hits of the future.

#### Content
The "Spotify dataset" file contains the daily ranking of the 200 most listened songs in 53 countries from 2017 and 2018 by Spotify users. It contains more than 2 million rows, which comprises 6629 artists, 18598 songs for a total count of one hundred five billion streams. The data spans from 1st January 2017 to 9th January 2018 and has been collected from Spotify's regional chart data.

The dataset is contained in only one file. Each row contains a ranking position on a specific day for a song. For instance, the first 200 rows present the ranking for the 1st of January in Argentina. The following 200 rows will contain the ranking for the 2nd of January in Argentina. The regions are alphabetically sorted.

Be aware that Spotify's data was missing in very few occasions, so choose data intervals carefully. Prefer to read everything and filter by region, date, so that you can be sure to have the required slices of data.

#### Assignment
1- Use this dataset to deduce up to 5 key insights. A brand new music label will use your insights as the analytical base for defining its scouting and producing strategy in the USA market.
2- Use you favorite dataviz tools to create an effective dashboard that you will share with all your stakeholders (CEO, product managers, producers and talent scouts)

NB: On purpose we let you chose which insights are the more interesting to share with which stakeholder or department.

#### EX. 2

**Dataset** ðŸ‘‰[here](../data/dataset_voodoo.csv)

#### Context
Nowadays mobile apps track user behaviours in many different and unexpected ways. User data are then used to improve business performances and user experience. Data teams and product teams are working more closely than ever and they often need to converge on a data-driven product strategy.

#### Content
The "Mobile video app dataset" file contains the raw logs of a Youtube-like mobile app. The logs are collected from users while they navigate the "home" section of the app (please consider the that the home page is like the one of the iOS/Android Youtube app. For simplicity sake consider there are just 20 video preview cells).

Here are the tracked events :
**user ID** = a unique user identifier
**has tapped cell** = whether or not the user has tapped on a video preview cell
**position of the cell** = the ordinary number assigned to the cell. In total there are 20 cells so the value is between 1 and 20. If user didn't tap on any cell 0 is the default value
**max scroll offset (pixels)** = the more the user scroll the more this value increases.
**reached bottom of scroll** = whether the user reached the bottom of the home page.
**time spent on screen (s)** = seconds the user spent on the home section screen.

#### Assignment

We ask you to:

1- list up to 3 key insights on users behaviours
2- if any particular behaviour is detected, for each insight propose an A/B testing strategy to get a deeper comprehension of the specific behaviour.


Please consider your insights and A/B testing proposals will be shared with the product team in order to improve UX by understanding, framing and eventually addressing the tracked behaviour.

#### Deadline
You have up to two days to hand in the test, but we consider you are going to need far less time. This is just a suggested deadline. It's even ok if you need more time to achieve a better result. In this case just write us an email where you explain the reasons of the delay.

#### Evaluation method
We are going to evaluate your project under different criteria:
analytical consistency
creativity
business coherence and relevance
ability to communicate your findings in a structured and efficient way
ability to adapt your recommendations to your different stakeholders
Provide a well written test and consider your results will be shared internally with all the stakeholders of the data team. So try to be as clear as possible. If you encounter any problem please feel free to contact us by email.
