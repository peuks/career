## Thinking Like a Recruiter 101:

**What do recruiters consider?**

1. Requirements: Candidate has knowledge
2. Culture: Does Candidate work with our company culture?
3. Logistics: Can Candidate get to the job easily
4. Retention: How long will Candidate stay?

## Tips to make your Linkedin Profile awesome

Have a look at our [Linkedin Workshop slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yggy_Fp6BRLvyxF8dz9Y_7_I43xmimv0ZPqNFi8hFCg/edit?usp=sharing) and follow the steps to improve the quality of your profile and considerably increase your visibility.

## Linkedin Profile

**Title:** Make it a phrase, not just a boring title.

**Your Profile summary:**

**Simple template for summary:** Sums up --> I want to do X at Y company because of Z.

Summary is the what and why

What = the knowledge you have

Why = What kind of culture are you looking for. === Retention at the company. Someone looking to hire you wants to know that you're gonna stay.

**Curate your profile for the job you want not the job you have.**

Make sure your profile says: **This is who I am**

Job Title = Your Knowledge

**Position description/phrase:** Instead of Fullstack Developer ‚Üí Creating amazing applications for the good of humanity(make it a phrase, not bland).

**Your location**

Update your location

**Add all Skills you have to skills area(recruiters/hiring managers do look here)**

Go to jobs tab and fill out form on open to new opportunities(very important).

**Add your dev or design Portfolio to profile**

**Get Referrals from friends ‚Üí Referrals boost changes of interviews**

**Profile needs to scream the title you have**

Want to be a UX researcher? Fullstack dev? etc. etc.

Your picture has to be in line with whatever job you want!

Very important: Have a centered headshot of you. Not a zoomed out picture. It goes a long way.

Hope that helps ‚ù§Ô∏è
