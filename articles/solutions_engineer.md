# Start a new career as a solutions engineer

## What is a Solutions Engineer?üí°
A solutions engineer (SE) is a person working closely with sales, customers, development, marketing, design, product teams **to deliver great solutions to the customer**. There is a constant feedback loop between customers and future development of a product and a good SE needs to be on top of all that.

A solutions engineer will help all teams to be successful in order to **deliver the right product to the right customer**. At times, he should be able to jump in and help all teams, whether it is to develop a new feature, help with the support of new or existing customers, suggest UI improvements and prioritize the roadmap ahead.

## What is the role of a solutions engineer?ü§∫

The number one responsibility **is the customer**. Solutions engineer role is probably the most customer-facing, technical role. The SE instead of focusing on the product that its customers will use **will focus on the customers who use the products**.

**SE roles vary from company to company, product to product** but here are some of the activities SE‚Äôs will participate in: 
- SE will often join on **discovery calls to collect customer‚Äôs requirements and uncover the bigger picture**. Discovery call is important to understand customer pain, listen and present possible ways how to solve the problem with the product at hand. A demo is an important visual tool to present a possible solution/vision for the end product. 
- Solutions Engineer will **help developers working for other companies with implementation, integration, configuration, customization of the product**. SE will help put together a POC and demo to management and C-level executives. Sometimes a solution can be missing a requested feature, SE will need to be able to put on a project management hat and provide a custom implementation, estimate hours involved, exact requirements and either manage developers to implement it or implement it themselves.
- Every company is different and they are using a different stack, implementation, frameworks. SE will need to be able to **solve and debug** whatever problems without having the exact idea of how it works but improvising on the fly. **An entrepreneurial and problem-solving mindset is best for this position**(perfect for a Le Wagon alumni!). 
- **Write documentation and articles** for a variety of technologies linked to the use of the platform. 

As I told you above, the role of a Solutions engineer vary from one company to another. Here is the testimony of an alumni SE at Alkemics üëáüèª

[Carla Dessommes](https://kitt.lewagon.com/alumni/carladss): *"In my company, I would say that the Solutions Engineer is 80% of the time developer and 20% in relation to the client. At Alkemics, its goal is to code custom solutions for corporate customers. The process is as follows: call with the client to specify and validate their needs, creation and validation of development specs, solution development, tests, customer feedback, deployment, solution delivery. After delivery, the SE is also in charge of resolving any bugs in the solution.
Organization level: all requests are managed in the form of tickets."*

## How to become a solutions engineer?üèÜ

It requires **many different skills**, you will need to work with different technologies, businesses and wear multiple hats to become a successful Solutions Engineer.

- **Business, management, and sales experience** are needed for this position. Whether you were previously a sales consultant, project manager or analyst, all of the above are transferrable skills to a solutions engineering role.

- **Technical skills**: You must have code basics!(Le Wagon training 
is more than enough). 

- **Soft skills like communication, customer service, creativity, problem-solving**


The position of Solution Engineer is a great balance between **learning new tech, business management and interacting with amazing people!**

üîë**Tips**: The most important thing is **to remain humble** in your onboarding and encourage more listening than initiatives. Indeed mistaking and explaining wrong things to developers will make you lose all credibility.

## How is the interview going?‚úçÔ∏è

The interview will consist of **technical questions, code problems, take-home assignments**. 

They will test you on your: 
- **understanding of the platform** 
- **tech environment knowledge**: they will ask you questions like : what are the components of a computer? how does a hard drive work? what is the web? how does an FTP server work? An api?...

The second point is very important for this position because **as we talk to customers** and their tech levels can vary altogether, **you have to be able to adapt to your interlocutor**. Explain what is an API to a tech is different from explaining it to a non-tech. 

Then they will send you a **Case study**

üîë**Tips**: Before the ITW, find out about the company its tools and its technical stack! And train yourself with code exercices with [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) üëâSimplified Tag Count, Pattern Matching, or Reverse Factorial.
During the ITW ask a lot of questions. It's the best way to find out if the job is likely to please you: ask for example projects, which clients, project deadlines (short or long), how many projects are manage in the same time, the visibility of projects over the next few months etc
And like always, make sure the team is ready to welcome and train a Wagon junior, it may seem obvious but it's better to ask.
